## Description of Dataset:
Demographic, Time, Location, and statistical data related to aids diagnoses in the city of New York. It includes both HIV and AIDS Diagnoses, as well as concurrent cases and per capita metrics. 


## Question 1:
What is the total number of HIV, AIDS, and Concurrent diagnoses in the state of NY sorted by year? For any given spikes, what was the distribution amongst boroughs?



## Question 2:
What is the distribution of the number of concurrent diagnoses amongst the various neighborhoods of NYC? What is the distribution amongst race and sex for the neighborhood with the most cases?


## Manipulations Applied to Dataset
We removed aggregate records to avoid double counting. Race, Sex, Borough, and Neighborhood all had a aggregate records with totals that we filtered out. Additionally, we filtered to only the years of 2016-2021 because there was a gap in data beteen 2013 and 2016. Additionally, we filtered out data with null entries in Borough, because that data was not recorded before 2016..
